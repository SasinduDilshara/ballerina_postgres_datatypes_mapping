# ballerina_postgres_datatypes_mapping

This project is to check the data types between postgresql and ballerina.
This project cntains three modules.

datatypes module - Check the data type mapping between postgresql and ballerina by insert and select data to database table
                 - To run this module 
                 
                     => Clone the project go to the root of the project
                     => Then run the following commands
                          $ balllerina build datatypes
                          $ ballerina run target/bin/datatypes.jar
                          
                          

datatypes module - Check the data type mapping between postgresql and ballerina by insert and select data to procedures
                 - To run this module
